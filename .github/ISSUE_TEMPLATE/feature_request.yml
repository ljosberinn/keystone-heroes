        The issue tracker is meant for feature requests and bug reports only. This isn't the best place for
        support or usage questions. Questions here don't have as much visibility as they do elsewhere. Before
        you ask a question, here are some resources to get help first:

        - Ask in GitHub Discussions: https://github.com/ljosberinn/keystone-heroes/discussions
